## Introduction
Welcome to Fern-UI, the front-end of the Fern Test Report Generator.
Fern-UI is an open-source React-based application
designed to provide a visual dashboard for viewing and analyzing Ginkgo test reports.
Built using the [Refine](https://github.com/refinedev/refine) framework,
Fern-UI connects to the Fern-Reporter backend to display a comprehensive overview of test executions,
their results, test insights and historical data.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Test Report Visualization**: View live test results and detailed reports directly from the Fern-Reporter backend.
- **Historical Data Tracking**: Access historical test data to monitor and review past test executions.
- **Latency and Performance Metrics**: Visualize the performance metrics captured by Fern-Reporter to identify bottlenecks.

## Installation and Setup
Fern-UI is a React-based application that communicates with the Fern-Reporter API.
Follow the steps below to set up and run Fern-UI.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js environment
- NPM or Yarn package manager
- Running instance of Fern-Reporter Server. Please refer to [Fern-Reporter](https://github.com/Guidewire/fern-reporter/blob/main/README.md#setting-up-the-api-server) setup instructions for more details.

### Development
1. **Clone the Fern-UI Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:Guidewire/fern-ui.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies.
    ```sh
    cd fern-ui
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Configure API Endpoint**: Update `VITE_FERN_REPORTER_BASE_URL` in `.env` to point to your running Fern-Reporter instance (this value is `http://localhost:8080/api` by default).
   To use the graphql endpoint, set `VITE_FERN_REPORTER_GRAPHQL_BASE_URL` in .env. This will value will be `http://localhost:8080/query`. For development and testing, the default value is currently a graphql mock server running locally on port 4000 `http://localhost:4000/graphql`. Running `npm run dev` will automatically run the graphql mock server with test data.


4. **Start the Application**: Run the front-end instance.
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

### Accessing the Dashboard
After starting the application, access the dashboard at `http://localhost:5173/` (or your specified port).

## Usage
Once the Fern-UI application is running, you can view and interact with test reports generated by Fern-Reporter.
Expand each of the test runs to explore detailed test data and results.

## Future Enhancements
- **Data-Driven Analytics**: Incorporating analytics to identify frequently failing tests and other insights.
- **Coverage and Test Evolution Analysis**: Offering insights into test coverage and evolution over time.
- **Authorized Access to Test Reports**: Implementing secure access controls for viewing test reports.
